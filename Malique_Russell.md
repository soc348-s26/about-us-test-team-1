Hello class,
My name is Malique Russell, and I am a senior here at Lehman College. My majors are Accounting and Business Administration, and a minor in Data Science. Which is why I am taking this class.
I am a lover of life, people, animals, food, good times, and new experiences.
I was recommended to take the Data Science minor in my sophomore year, and after seeing all the cool stuff data tools can do, I've been hooked.
I hope we get to explore and learn a lot together in this course this semester.
Nice to meet you!
