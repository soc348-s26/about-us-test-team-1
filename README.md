# about-us
Hello 348

In this repository I want each of you to add your own file introducing yourselves. 

You can do this  online in Github.  

Go to the Code tab, and find the "+" between the search box and the green "code" button.

Click "Create New File".   

Make the file called myname.md  but putting your own name (no spaces but you can use _ or - if you want).

Start off the file with your name, your major and then some other interesting things for your classmates and me to know. 

When you have the basic information, click "commit changes" and followthe instructions.

If you want to make changes you can always edit the document and commit the changes. Try doing that a few times for practice.
